# Double-interval-censored-competing-risks
The R code for the function to analyze the data using all methods described in Ramjith et al. (2022), the simulation generating code for all scenarios, and the malaria data used in the study.

model function.R is the function to apply all models to the data and the READ ME document explains all input arguments as well as what variables are required in the data file.

Simulation function.R and simulation function_notuniform_start.R are the functions to generate the simulated data. 

Malaria example.R is the R code used in the analysis of the malaria data.

The simulation results for the simulation scenarios are contained in https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20756668.v1
